# Learning JavaScript

On my frontend development path, I have discovered that learning with examples and practice is the best choice. <br>
Therefore, I have decided to add basic examples while moving along with the theoretical parts of discovering JavaScript. These easy examples are followed by short explanations or definitions to help me understand better some aspects for when I will open them again. <br><br>
So far, you can check examples of:
<ul>
  <li>Operators</li>
  <li>Conditional statements (if, if else, switch)</li>
  <li>Loops (for, while, nested)</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
