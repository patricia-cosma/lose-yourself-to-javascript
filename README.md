# Learning JavaScript

On my frontend development path, I have discovered that learning with examples and practice is the best choice. <br>
Therefore, I have decided to add basic examples while moving along with the theoretical parts of discovering JavaScript. These easy examples are followed by short explanations or definitions to help me understand better some aspects for when I will open them again. <br><br>
So far, you can check examples of:
<ul>
  <li>Operators (logical operators, % (modulus) operator, += operator, type coercion)</li>
  <li>Conditional statements (if... else, if... else if... else, switch)</li>
  <li>Loops (for, while, nested)</li>
  <li>Functions (with & without paramaters, locate position, defensive programming)</li>
  <li>Arrays (declare, display, add, remove, build & call functions, arrays as objects, strings != arrays)</li>
  <li>Objects (declare, add, update, remove, dot & brackets notations, methods, typeof operator, Math object)</li>
  <li>Error handling (most common errors, try... catch blocks, manual error, error prevention, undefined, null & empty variables</li>
  <li>Cheet sheet (strings)</li>
  <li>Functional programming (function calling & recursion, scope, higher-order function)</li>
</ul>
  
  
  
  # Write code & learn
  
  Beside learning step by step the basic elements of JavaScript, I find it useful to take small and easy projects that require only vanilla JavaScript and try to understand what each element is doing, by implementing the project in my own way.
  On this part of the repository, I added so far:
  <ol>
    <li>Drum Kit</li>
  </ol>
